# The Ancient Game of Go!

The first personal project I ever worked on. Coded in Java + Processing. To play, just run the .pde file in Processing. Two players required.

The goal of this (simplified) version of Go is to have the most pieces on the board. If you totally surround a group of your opponent's pieces, they are removed from the board.
